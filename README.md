- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nataliesayth
- ðŸŒ± I've worked in the FBI, Planned Parenthood, and TV writersâ€™ rooms.
- âš¡ As a data analyst and even outside of that work, my ethos is efficiency in communication. 
- ðŸ‘€ This should be apparent in all my work, from Python or SQL-coded notebooks to Tableau visualizations and analytic prose.
- âœ¨ I'm a curious self-starter and supportive collaborator with a steady commitment to source integrity.
- ðŸ˜„ Letâ€™s have a conversation! Iâ€™m up to the challenge of contextualizing information in a way you hadnâ€™t considered.
- ðŸ“« Reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-sayth-60111a3a/), view my work on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/natalie.sayth/vizzes), or email me at natalie dot sayth at gmail dot com
